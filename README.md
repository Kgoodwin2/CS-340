How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think that programs need to be developed over time, with an ample amount of planning because the more knowledge goes in to creating the app, the better it will function. CRUD is a goodorganizational structure tocarry through your work and I can see myself using this many times over in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

This project was uniquley different and complicated in its own way for me because of the way MongoDB and Jupyter communicate, I am used to just one simple IDE,no frills. It has been verry complicated, but I can see how the functionality of developing this way is necessary in many projects. This project required me to go back and correct old work and it was not the standard work then build on method I a used to. Although more complicated, it is more adaptable in the development process.
